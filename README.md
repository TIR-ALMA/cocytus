# Cocytus
This is an extremely stealthy and destructively malicious software, one of the projects from "Ponds of Hell."

Cocytus is a UEFI Rootkit + Bootkit + Payload Injector. It is built on the source code of the BlackLotus malware. Cocytus's goal is to boot into UEFI from, for example, a Trojan, launch before Windows, stop the cooling fans, maximally load and overheat the CPU, GPU, RAM, and storage drive, and simply completely physically destroy a device running the Windows system. It works from Windows 7–11 to newer Windows systems and successfully bypasses many antivirus programs.

I am not the author of this malware. Where I got it from—I'll probably tell you later.
